                    The Image Data Resource (IDR) publishes “reference image” datasets supporting conventional peer-reviewed
                    publications and integrates them with other imaging datasets for cross-dataset querying of metadata
                    (e.g. genes, phenotypes, small molecules) and re-analysis.

                        <p>Metadata describing an imaging study is submitted using template files.
                        These are available for download from
                        <a href="https://github.com/IDR/idr0000-lastname-example/archive/master.zip">

                        <p>There are template files for two different use cases:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Templates for <b>high content screens</b> (HCS),
                            or imaging studies performed in plates (e.g. 96 or 384 well plates)</li>
                            <li>Templates for non-screen datasets, or studies which group images
                            into a number of distinct experiments</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>There are help pages to provide more information about filling out the
                        high content screen and non-screen dataset templates.</p>

                        <p>For both types of study three files should be submitted:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Study file</b> - describing the overall study and the screens or experiments that were performed</li>
                            <li><b>Library</b> (screens) or <b>assay</b> files (non-screens).  For HCS the library file describes the
                            plate layout of each screen.  If more than one screen is performed as part of the study there
                            should be a library file for each screen. For non-screen datasets, the assay file(s) describes
                            each imaging experiment included in the study.</li>
                            <li><b>Processed data</b> files - containing summary results and/or a ‘hit' list for each screen
                            or experiment.  It may include phenotypes observed.</li>
                        </ul></p>

                        <p>Example files for HCS studies can be found here:
                        <ul>
                            <li>idr0001 - gene deletion screen</li>

                        </ul></p>

                        <p>Example files for non-screen studies can be found here:
                        <ul>
                            <li>idr0018 - histopathology of gene knockouts</li>
                            <li>idr0021 - protein localization using 3D-SIM  </li>
                            <li>idr0023 - protein localization using dSTORM</li>
                            <li>idr0027 - 3D-tracking of tagged chromatin loci</li>
                            <li>idr0032 - in situ hybridzation of RNA</li>
                        </ul></p>

                        <p>Each study is slightly different and advice on how to fill in the template can be given.

                        <p>Imaging datasets can be remarkably complex. To the extent that it's well-structured
                        and reusable by the community, we are interested in enriching your online dataset with

                                <li>Rendering settings: if you have information on the channel intensities or
                                mappings that you would like to see displayed in the IDR, please let us know.</li>
                                <li>Regions of interest: if you have ROIs or masks, whether detected automatically
                                or hand-annotated, we'd like to make them available in the IDR.</li>
                                <li>Features: if you've calculated features for your dataset for machine learning,
                                we'd be interested in sharing those analysis results with others.</li>
                                <li>Pipelines and workflows: further, if you have a representation of how you ran
                                the analysis itself, we think that should be included with your features.</li>
